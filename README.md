# openFrameworks eclipse plugin

The openFrameworks plugin for eclipse allows to create new openFrameworks projects, import existing ones and add or remove addons to a project.

It's only been tested under linux by now.

You can install it as any other eclipse plugin from the install software menu from the site:
